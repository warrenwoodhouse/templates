Hello everyone,

I'm currently unavailable and I might not be able to respond to your email as I’m on holiday. When I return, I will read all the emails that you have sent me and I will reply back to all of them.

Until then, please take a look at my videos at
https://youtube.com/user/warrenwoodhouse , photos at
https://warrenwoodhouse.tumblr.com/tagged/photos and please feel free
to check out the rest of my blog at

When I come back from my holiday, I’ll upload my photos and share them
on my blog which you’ll then be able to leave a comment on at https://warrenwoodhouse.tumblr.com/tagged/holiday

Thank you so much for your patience. Alternatively, you can send
messages to me at https://tumblr.com/messaging/conversation/warrenwoodhouse
